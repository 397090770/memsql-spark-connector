This repository contains two projects for interfacing between spark and MemSQL.
The connector directory contains functions for going back and forth between
MemSQL tables and Spark RDDs. The dataSource directory contains a higher-level
interface for interacting with MemSQL using the Spark Data Sources API. The two
projects can be used independently. See each directory's README for more.
